# izzyPlugin-web_http_load_page

A Windows only plugin for Isadora. A simple, blocking, webpage text loader.
Useful for easy loading of JSON data or other text based information from a URL.
Supports both HTTP and HTTPS addresses.

The working DLL is available in the 'izzy_plugin' folder. Simply drop this into your Isadora plugins folder and
 relaunch Isadora to have access to the new Actor.
 
The source requires the Isadora SDK as well as additional libraries (not included to honor licenses). Comments in the code supply details.

**Development of this plugin has ended.** Isadora 2.6.1 now includes a native cross-platform actor, 'Get URL Text'.
